    <h1>Hello, Gakko!</h1>
    <p>
    I took my route through Chinatown busled with the traffic jam at Canal Street. <br>
    I took my time jaywalking across the narrow streets. <br>
    I jumped over common obstacles laid out by local restaurants: the mysterious green puddles and the hoses blasting at the invisible weeds I cannot see on the ground.
